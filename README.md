This project features the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe which has been built using React. It currently allows users to play this game with 2 players. Single player will not be available as part of the first release, but is in the pipeline once 2 player mode is complete.

## Prerequisites

Before running the React Tic-Tac-Toe App, make sure you have the following software and tools installed on your machine:

- Node.js v18.16.0 or later
- npm (Node Package Manager) - this comes bundled with Node.js
- Visual Studio Code (or any other code editor of your choice)

## Installation

To install and run the React Tic-Tac-Toe App, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/SMelidoni/react-tictactoe-app.git`

Note: By default, the `develop` branch will be checked out. However, if you want to use the most stable version, please check out the `main` branch by running: `git checkout main`

2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd react-tictactoe-app`
3. Install the dependencies using npm: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

Note: This project was developed using Node.js v18.16.0 and Visual Studio Code, but you can use any code editor of your choice.

## Usage

To use the tic-tac-toe app, follow these steps:

### 2 Player Mode

1. Launch the app and select the "2 Player" mode from the main menu.
2. Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) will take turns selecting an empty cell on the grid.
3. To make a move, click on the desired empty cell.
4. The game will continue until one player wins by aligning three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the board is full and the game ends in a draw.
5. At the end of the game, the app will display the result (win, lose, or draw) and reward the winner with one point. A new round will then begin.

### Single Player Mode (Coming Soon)

The Single Player Mode is currently under development and will be available in a future update. In this mode, you will be able to play against an AI opponent with various difficulty levels, providing a challenging and enjoyable experience.
