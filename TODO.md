# To-Do List

## High Priority

- [ ] Add animation when selecting square, smoother transitions (transform 'x' or 'o')
- [ ] Set up a Redux store for state management (score storing)

## Low Priority

- [ ] Make page more responsive (mobile and desktop)
- [ ] Add styling for scores
- [ ] Add 'Reset Game' button
- [x] Comment code
- [ ] Refactor SCSS

# Ideas

- Add better animation for when three match
